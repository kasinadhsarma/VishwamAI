# VishwamAI Model

VishwamAI is an advanced language model based on the Transformer architecture, designed for various natural language processing tasks.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vishwam_ai.git
   cd vishwam_ai
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Training the model

To train the VishwamAI model, run:

```
python scripts/train.py
```

This script will load the configuration from `configs/default_config.yaml`, initialize the model and datasets, and start the training process.

### Generating text

To generate text using a trained model, use:

```
python scripts/generate_text.py --prompt "Your prompt here" --max_length 100
```

### Evaluating the model

To evaluate the model on a test dataset, run:

```
python scripts/evaluate.py --test_file path/to/test/file.txt
```

## Configuration

You can modify the model and training configuration by editing the `configs/default_config.yaml` file.
