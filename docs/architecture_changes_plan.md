# Architectural Changes Plan for VishwamAI

## Overview

This document outlines the architectural changes needed to support MMLU math reasoning and other specified features in the VishwamAI model. The changes include enhancing the dataset, preprocessing steps, model architecture, training process, and evaluation metrics.

## Dataset Enhancement

1. **Identify Suitable Datasets**:
   - Mathematics Dataset (Google DeepMind)
   - MATH Dataset
   - MathQA
   - Papers With Code Datasets

2. **Integrate Datasets**:
   - Download and preprocess the datasets to ensure they are in a format compatible with the VishwamAI model.
   - Augment the existing training dataset with these math reasoning datasets.

## Preprocessing Steps

1. **Mathematical Notation Handling**:
   - Implement preprocessing steps to handle mathematical notation and symbols.
   - Use libraries like `sympy` for symbolic mathematics and `latex2mathml` for LaTeX to MathML conversion.

2. **Input Data Preprocessing**:
   - Modify the `preprocess_input` function in `trainer.py` to include steps for handling mathematical notation.
   - Ensure that the preprocessing steps are applied consistently across training, evaluation, and inference.

## Model Architecture

1. **Specialized Layers**:
   - Incorporate specialized layers or attention mechanisms that can better understand and generate mathematical content.
   - Explore the use of graph neural networks (GNNs) or other architectures that can handle structured data like mathematical expressions.

2. **Embedding Enhancements**:
   - Enhance the embedding layer to include representations for mathematical symbols and notation.
   - Use pre-trained embeddings for mathematical content if available.

## Training Process

1. **Curriculum Learning**:
   - Implement curriculum learning strategies to gradually introduce more complex mathematical reasoning tasks during training.
   - Adjust the training schedule to focus more on math reasoning examples.

2. **Loss Function Modifications**:
   - Modify the loss function to account for the unique challenges of mathematical reasoning, such as symbolic accuracy and logical consistency.

## Evaluation Metrics

1. **Custom Metrics**:
   - Implement custom evaluation metrics that can accurately assess the model's performance on math reasoning tasks.
   - Metrics may include symbolic accuracy, logical consistency, and problem-solving steps.

2. **Self-Evaluation**:
   - Enhance the self-evaluation methods in `architecture.py` to include checks for mathematical coherence and correctness.
   - Use the `generate_with_evaluation` method to assess the model's performance on math reasoning tasks.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Dataset Integration**:
   - Download and preprocess the identified datasets.
   - Integrate the datasets into the training pipeline.

2. **Preprocessing Implementation**:
   - Implement the preprocessing steps for mathematical notation.
   - Update the `preprocess_input` function in `trainer.py`.

3. **Model Architecture Modifications**:
   - Implement the specialized layers and embedding enhancements.
   - Update the `ImprovedVishwamAIModel` and `VishwamAILLM` classes in `architecture.py`.

4. **Training Process Adjustments**:
   - Implement curriculum learning strategies.
   - Modify the loss function for math reasoning tasks.

5. **Evaluation Metrics Implementation**:
   - Implement custom evaluation metrics.
   - Enhance the self-evaluation methods in `architecture.py`.
