# Training Instructions for VishwamAI Chat Agent Model

## 1. Sourcing Datasets from the Internet

To source datasets from the internet, you can use various APIs and web scraping techniques. Here are some common methods:

### Using APIs
- **Hugging Face Datasets**: You can use the `datasets` library from Hugging Face to download and prepare datasets.
  ```python
  from datasets import load_dataset

  dataset = load_dataset('dataset_name')
  ```

### Web Scraping
- **BeautifulSoup**: You can use BeautifulSoup to scrape data from web pages.
  ```python
  import requests
  from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

  url = 'https://example.com'
  response = requests.get(url)
  soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
  data = soup.find_all('p')
  ```

## 2. Preprocessing and Formatting CSV Files for Training

To preprocess and format CSV files for training, follow these steps:

### Reading CSV Files
- Use the `pandas` library to read CSV files.
  ```python
  import pandas as pd

  df = pd.read_csv('path/to/your/csvfile.csv')
  ```

### Preprocessing Data
- Clean and preprocess the data as needed.
  ```python
  df = df.dropna()  # Remove missing values
  df['text'] = df['text'].str.lower()  # Convert text to lowercase
  ```

### Saving Preprocessed Data
- Save the preprocessed data to a new CSV file.
  ```python
  df.to_csv('path/to/your/preprocessed_csvfile.csv', index=False)
  ```

## 3. Setting Up the Training Environment

Ensure that all dependencies are installed by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 4. Running the `train.py` Script with Prepared Datasets

To run the `train.py` script with your prepared datasets, follow these steps:

### Modify the Configuration File
- Update the `configs/default_config.yaml` file with the paths to your datasets and any other necessary configurations.

### Execute the Training Script
- Run the `train.py` script to start the training process.
  ```bash
  python3 train.py
  ```

## 5. Monitoring the Training Process and Evaluating the Model's Performance

### Monitoring Training Loss
- Monitor the training loss to ensure the model is learning correctly. You can add print statements in the `train.py` script to output the training loss at regular intervals.

### Evaluating Model Performance
- After training, evaluate the model's performance using a validation dataset. You can modify the `evaluate.py` script to use your validation dataset and output performance metrics.

By following these instructions, you should be able to train the VishwamAI chat agent model with various datasets, including CSV files and data sourced from the internet. If you encounter any issues or have specific requirements, please refer to the provided scripts and documentation for further guidance.
