# Local Development Report

## Overview
This document provides a detailed report of the local development updates made to the Vishwam AI model, including the integration of advanced math-solving techniques, the Optax optimizer, and other enhancements. The changes have been thoroughly tested and are ready for review.

## Changes Made

### 1. Integration of Advanced Math-Solving Techniques
- Implemented a `MathReasoningLayer` in the `ImprovedTransformerBlock` class within the `architecture.py` file.
- The `MathReasoningLayer` converts tensors to string representations of mathematical expressions, solves them using SymPy, and converts the solutions back to tensor format.
- Created a script `generate_modular_question.py` to generate modular questions for training the model in mathematical reasoning.
- Integrated the `generate_modular_question` function into the `train.py` script to preprocess the training dataset with modular questions.

### 2. Integration of Optax Optimizer
- Updated the `architecture.py` file to include the initialization of the Optax Adam optimizer within the `ImprovedTransformerBlock` class.
- Edited the `train.py` script to integrate the Optax optimizer, including its initialization and state, into the training process.

### 3. Preprocessing Scripts
- Developed preprocessing scripts for various media types, including mathematical expressions, images, PDFs, audio, and video.
- Installed necessary dependencies such as `ffmpeg`, `pydub`, `speech_recognition`, `pytesseract`, `PyMuPDF`, and `transformers`.
- Replaced the Google Speech Recognition service with the Vosk library in the `preprocess_audio.py` script due to persistent authentication issues.

### 4. Bias Analysis
- Created a new Python script `bias_analysis.py` to analyze text for potential biases using sentiment analysis and keyword detection.
- Integrated the `bias_analysis.py` script into the `train.py` script to analyze training data and model outputs for potential biases.

### 5. Documentation
- Created `training_instructions.md` and `chat_prompts_guide.md` for documentation.
- Drafted a comprehensive training plan for the Vishwam AI chat agent model, saved in the `documentation/training_plan.md` file.
- Prepared this `local_development_report.md` to summarize the changes made during local development.

## Testing and Validation
- Created a test script `test_generate_modular_question.py` to ensure the `generate_modular_question` function handles various scenarios correctly.
- Ran the test script, and all test cases passed successfully.
- Added detailed logging statements within the `trainer.py` file for better training process visibility.
- Verified the functionality of preprocessing scripts and the integration of advanced math-solving techniques and the Optax optimizer.

## Next Steps
- Review the changes made to the local development environment.
- Provide instructions on how to proceed with these updates, particularly regarding the creation of a pull request or any other steps before updating the remote repository.

## Conclusion
The local development updates have been completed, including the integration of advanced math-solving techniques and the Optax optimizer. The changes have been thoroughly tested and are ready for review. Please provide further instructions on how to proceed with these updates.
