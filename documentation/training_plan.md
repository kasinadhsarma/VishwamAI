# Training Plan for VishwamAI Chat Agent Model

## Introduction
This document outlines the steps necessary to train the VishwamAI chat agent model. The training plan includes the setup of the training environment, dataset preparation, model configuration, training procedures, and evaluation metrics.

## Training Environment Setup
1. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure all required dependencies are installed. This includes libraries such as TensorFlow, JAX, Haiku, and others specified in the `requirements.txt` file.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Configure Environment Variables**: Set up any necessary environment variables, such as authentication tokens for accessing datasets and model repositories.

3. **Directory Structure**: Ensure the directory structure is organized as follows:
   ```
   VishwamAI-main/
   ├── configs/
   ├── data/
   ├── documentation/
   ├── models/
   ├── scripts/
   ├── src/
   ├── tests/
   ├── checkpoints/
   └── saved_models/
   ```

## Dataset Preparation
1. **Collect Datasets**: Gather datasets from various sources, including CSV files, internet data, and other relevant sources. Ensure datasets are diverse and representative of the tasks the model will perform.

2. **Preprocess Datasets**: Use preprocessing scripts to prepare the datasets for training. This includes converting audio, video, images, PDFs, and mathematical expressions into a format suitable for model training.
   ```bash
   python scripts/preprocess_audio.py
   python scripts/preprocess_video.py
   python scripts/preprocess_images.py
   python scripts/preprocess_pdfs.py
   python scripts/preprocess_math.py
   ```

3. **Split Datasets**: Divide the datasets into training, validation, and test sets to ensure the model is evaluated on unseen data.

## Model Configuration
1. **Load Configuration**: Load the model configuration from the `configs/default_config.yaml` file. This file contains hyperparameters and other settings necessary for training.
   ```python
   with open('configs/default_config.yaml', 'r') as f:
       config = yaml.safe_load(f)
   ```

2. **Initialize Tokenizer**: Initialize the tokenizer using the specified tokenizer name in the configuration file.
   ```python
   tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(config['tokenizer_name'])
   ```

3. **Configure Model Architecture**: Ensure the model architecture is correctly set up, including any custom layers such as the `MathReasoningLayer`.

## Training Procedure
1. **Initialize Model**: Initialize the model with the specified configuration and tokenizer.
   ```python
   model = VishwamAILLM(config)
   ```

2. **Train Model**: Train the model using the training dataset. Monitor training loss and evaluation metrics to ensure the model is learning effectively.
   ```python
   trained_params = trainer.train(params, train_dataset, eval_dataset, config['num_epochs'])
   ```

3. **Save Checkpoints**: Save model checkpoints periodically to allow for resuming training if interrupted.
   ```python
   checkpoint_dir = 'checkpoints'
   os.makedirs(checkpoint_dir, exist_ok=True)
   checkpoint_path = os.path.join(checkpoint_dir, 'model_checkpoint.npy')
   np.save(checkpoint_path, trained_params)
   ```

4. **Evaluate Model**: Evaluate the model on the validation and test sets to measure its performance.
   ```python
   evaluation_metrics = trainer.evaluate(params, eval_dataset)
   ```

## Memory Usage Monitoring
1. **Monitor Memory Usage**: Use the `top` command in batch mode to log memory usage at regular intervals during the training process. This data can be used to create a graph or report showing memory usage over time.
   ```bash
   top -b -d 10 -n 360 > memory_usage.txt
   ```

2. **Analyze Memory Usage Data**: After the training process is complete, analyze the memory usage data logged in the `memory_usage.txt` file to identify any memory-related issues or bottlenecks.
   ```python
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

   # Read memory usage data from file
   with open('memory_usage.txt', 'r') as f:
       lines = f.readlines()

   # Extract memory usage values
   memory_usage = [float(line.split()[9]) for line in lines if 'KiB Mem' in line]

   # Plot memory usage
   plt.plot(memory_usage)
   plt.xlabel('Time (s)')
   plt.ylabel('Memory Usage (MB)')
   plt.title('Memory Usage During Training')
   plt.show()
   ```

## Evaluation Metrics
1. **Accuracy**: Measure the accuracy of the model on various tasks, including MMLU math reasoning and other benchmarks.

2. **Loss**: Monitor the training and validation loss to ensure the model is converging.

3. **Bias and Fairness**: Analyze the model's responses to ensure they are non-repetitive and unbiased. Use text analysis techniques to identify and mitigate any biases.

## Advanced Math Solving Methods
1. **Modular and Compositional Dataset**: Implement a modular and compositional dataset for mathematical reasoning, where questions are generated by chaining modules with matching input and output types. This approach ensures that the model can handle complex mathematical problems by breaking them down into simpler, modular components.
    ```python
    # Example of modular question generation
    question = generate_modular_question(modules)
    ```

2. **Autoregressive Prediction**: Use autoregressive prediction with a greedy decoder for training sequence-to-sequence models. This method allows the model to generate sequences of text by predicting one token at a time, which is crucial for tasks like mathematical reasoning where the output depends on the previous tokens.
    ```python
    # Example of autoregressive prediction
    output = model.generate(input_ids, max_length=config['max_length'], do_sample=False)
    ```

3. **Exact Match Evaluation**: Evaluate the model based on exact character-for-character matches with the correct answer. This evaluation metric is essential for tasks like mathematical reasoning, where precision is critical.
    ```python
    # Example of exact match evaluation
    def exact_match(prediction, ground_truth):
        return prediction == ground_truth
    ```

## Conclusion
This training plan provides a comprehensive guide to training the VishwamAI chat agent model. By following these steps, the model can be trained effectively to achieve high performance on various tasks, including text-to-text generation, mathematical reasoning, and more.
