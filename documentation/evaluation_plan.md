## Introduction
This document outlines the evaluation plan for the Vishwam AI model, focusing on its mathematical reasoning abilities. The evaluation system is designed to measure the model's performance on various mathematical tasks, ensuring it can handle complex problem-solving and generalize beyond the training environments.

## Objectives
1. Develop a new evaluation system to accurately measure the model's mathematical reasoning abilities.
2. Ensure the model can handle fast-form text input/output formats for questions and answers.
3. Explore different neural architectures to enhance the model's capabilities.
4. Improve the model's generalization abilities to handle a wider variety of mathematical reasoning tasks.
5. Implement complex problem-solving tasks to test the model's understanding and problem-solving skills.

## Evaluation System
### 1. Evaluation Metrics
- **Accuracy**: Measure the percentage of correct answers provided by the model.
- **Precision and Recall**: Evaluate the model's ability to identify relevant information and provide accurate answers.
- **F1 Score**: Calculate the harmonic mean of precision and recall to provide a balanced evaluation metric.
- **Generalization Score**: Assess the model's ability to generalize beyond the training data by testing it on unseen problems.

### 2. Evaluation Framework
- **Dataset Preparation**: Create a diverse set of mathematical problems, including simple arithmetic, algebra, calculus, and complex problem-solving tasks.
- **Question Format**: Ensure questions are presented in a fast-form text input/output format, requiring the model to parse and understand the questions and generate answers in a natural language format.
- **Evaluation Procedure**: Implement a strict evaluation procedure to assess the model's performance on the prepared dataset. The procedure will include:
  - Parsing the questions and generating answers using the Vishwam AI model.
  - Comparing the generated answers with the correct answers to calculate accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
  - Testing the model on unseen problems to calculate the generalization score.
