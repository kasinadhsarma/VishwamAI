# Integration Instructions for Enhancements to Vishwam AI Model

## Overview

This document provides detailed instructions for integrating the recent enhancements made to the Vishwam AI model. These enhancements focus on improving the model's mathematical reasoning capabilities, integrating a new dataset for evaluation, and adding bias analysis functionality.

## Changes Made

### 1. Model Architecture Enhancements

- **File:** `src/model/architecture.py`
- **Changes:**
  - Added `MathReasoningLayer` to handle mathematical reasoning by converting tensors to string representations of mathematical expressions, solving them using SymPy, and converting the solutions back to tensor format.
  - Improved the `ImprovedTransformerBlock` class to support advanced mathematical reasoning capabilities.

### 2. Preprocessing Scripts

- **Files:**
  - `scripts/preprocess_audio.py`
  - `scripts/preprocess_pdf.py`
  - `scripts/preprocess_math.py`
- **Changes:**
  - Developed preprocessing scripts for various media types, including audio, PDF, and mathematical expressions.
  - Ensured all dependencies are installed and corrected file paths using `os.path.join` and `os.path.dirname(__file__)` for dynamic path construction.

### 3. Bias Analysis

- **File:** `scripts/bias_analysis.py`
- **Changes:**
  - Created a script to analyze text for potential biases using sentiment analysis and keyword detection.
  - Integrated the bias analysis script into the `train.py` script to analyze training data and model outputs for potential biases.

### 4. Evaluation Script

- **File:** `scripts/evaluate.py`
- **Changes:**
  - Added the parent directory to the system path to resolve import issues.
  - Enhanced the evaluation script to load the configuration, initialize the tokenizer, create the evaluation dataset, load trained parameters, evaluate the model, and analyze model outputs for biases.

### 5. Training Plan

- **File:** `documentation/training_plan.md`
- **Changes:**
  - Drafted a comprehensive training plan for the Vishwam AI chat agent model, including steps for setting up the training environment, preparing datasets, configuring the model, executing the training procedure, and evaluating the model's performance.

## Integration Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VishwamAI/chat-agent.git
   cd chat-agent
   ```

2. **Set Up the Environment:**
   - Install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
   - Ensure that all necessary libraries and tools, such as `ffmpeg`, `pydub`, `speech_recognition`, `pytesseract`, and `poppler-utils`, are installed.

3. **Update the Model Architecture:**
   - Replace the existing `src/model/architecture.py` file with the updated version provided in this documentation.

4. **Add Preprocessing Scripts:**
   - Add the new preprocessing scripts (`preprocess_audio.py`, `preprocess_pdf.py`, `preprocess_math.py`) to the `scripts` directory.

5. **Integrate Bias Analysis:**
   - Add the `bias_analysis.py` script to the `scripts` directory.
   - Ensure that the `train.py` script is updated to include the bias analysis functionality.

6. **Update the Evaluation Script:**
   - Replace the existing `scripts/evaluate.py` file with the updated version provided in this documentation.

7. **Follow the Training Plan:**
   - Refer to the `documentation/training_plan.md` file for detailed instructions on setting up the training environment, preparing datasets, configuring the model, executing the training procedure, and evaluating the model's performance.

8. **Run the Evaluation:**
   - Execute the `evaluate.py` script to evaluate the model's performance and analyze the outputs for biases.

   ```bash
   python scripts/evaluate.py
   ```
