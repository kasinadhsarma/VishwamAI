# Bias Analysis Guide

This document provides an overview of the bias analysis process implemented in the `bias_analysis.py` script. The purpose of this script is to analyze text data for potential biases using sentiment analysis and keyword detection. This guide explains how to use the script and its role in the model training pipeline.

## Purpose

The bias analysis script is designed to identify and mitigate biases in the training data and the model's outputs. By analyzing the text for sentiment and detecting bias-related keywords, we can ensure that the model is fair and unbiased.

## Script Overview

The `bias_analysis.py` script includes the following key components:

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Uses the Hugging Face `transformers` library to perform sentiment analysis on the text.
- **Keyword Detection**: Detects predefined bias-related keywords and phrases in the text.

## How to Use the Script

To run the bias analysis script, execute the following command in the terminal:

```bash
python3 scripts/bias_analysis.py
```

The script will analyze the example text provided in the `main` function and print the analysis results, including the sentiment and detected biases.

## Integration into the Training Pipeline

The bias analysis script can be integrated into the model training pipeline to analyze the training data and model outputs for biases. Here are the steps to integrate the script:

1. **Pre-Training Data Analysis**: Use the `analyze_bias` function to analyze the training data for potential biases before training the model. This step ensures that the training data is fair and unbiased.

2. **Post-Training Output Analysis**: After training the model, use the `analyze_bias` function to analyze the model's outputs for biases. This step helps identify any biases that may have been introduced during training.

3. **Bias Mitigation**: Based on the analysis results, take appropriate actions to mitigate any detected biases. This may involve modifying the training data, adjusting the model's parameters, or implementing additional bias mitigation techniques.

## Example

Here is an example of how to use the `analyze_bias` function in a Python script:

```python
from bias_analysis import analyze_bias

# Example text for analysis
example_text = "This is an example text that may contain biased language or sentiments."

# Analyze the example text for biases
results = analyze_bias(example_text)

# Print the analysis results
print("Bias Analysis Results:")
print(f"Sentiment: {results['sentiment']}")
print(f"Detected Biases: {', '.join(results['detected_biases']) if results['detected_biases'] else 'None'}")
```

## Conclusion

The bias analysis script is a valuable tool for ensuring that the Vishwam AI model is fair and unbiased. By integrating this script into the training pipeline, we can analyze the training data and model outputs for potential biases and take appropriate actions to mitigate them. This guide provides an overview of the script and its usage, helping you to implement bias analysis in your model training process.
